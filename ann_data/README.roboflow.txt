The dataset includes 3640 images.
Sperms are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -5 and +5 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 2 percent of pixels
